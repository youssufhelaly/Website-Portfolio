      "I had the pleasure of hiring and mentoring Youssuf during his co-op term at Nokia, and I can confidently say he made a lasting impression on our team. Despite being only in his second year of university, Youssuf consistently demonstrated a level of maturity and professionalism well beyond his years. From day one, Youssuf proved to be incredibly productive — tackling complex tasks with focus, speed, and quality. He showed initiative in every aspect of his work and didn’t hesitate to dive into unfamiliar territory to deliver results. What stood out the most was his ambition. Youssuf is driven, goal-oriented, and always looking for ways to grow — both personally and professionally. It’s rare to come across someone so early in their career who is this intentional about their development. I have no doubt that Youssuf has a bright future ahead of him, and I look forward to seeing where his career takes him.",

      "I had the pleasure of working with Youssuf, and he was an absolute joy to have on the team. He quickly adapted to new challenges, learning fast and making a meaningful impact on our automation efforts. Youssuf played a key role in kick-starting our automation framework, conducting research, running mock tests during the proof of concept phase, and helping to implement API tests and fixtures in Pytest. His proficiency in Python and his ability to quickly pick up Playwright made him a valuable asset to the team. His curiosity and attention to detail were an asset. He was eager to learn, asked insightful questions, and actively applied feedback, making it easy for senior team members to mentor him. His ability to take ownership and collaborate effectively made him a fantastic team player. Any team would be lucky to have Youssuf, and I highly recommend him for any role that values technical skill, initiative, and collaboration! I would definitely hire him again :)",
